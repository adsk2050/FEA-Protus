Python 2.7 - Finitie Element code for 2D quadrilateral plane stress/plane strain applications using linear isoparametric formulation with full integration
With more than 14 years of Finite Element Analysis experience and as a passionate fan of the Finite Element Method, I wrote this simple code in Python 2.7 to solve plane stress/plane strain linear-elastic problems and to help other enthusiasts to better understand how to implement the Finite Element Method.
The script probably is not considered a “computational efficient” code (I am a mechanical engineer, not a software engineer!!), but I hope it is useful.
I strongly encourage the user to read the reference books below:
1.	Finite Element Procedures by Klaus-Jurgen Bathe
2.	The Finite Element Method by Olek C Zienkiewicz
3.	The Finite Element Method for Solid and Structural Mechanics by Olek C Zienkiewicz
4.	Introduction to the Finite Element Method” by J N Reddy
5.	The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis by Thomas J. R. Hughes
Enjoy it!!!
